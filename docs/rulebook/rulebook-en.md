```

2. **Divine Judgment** - God's interference check
3. **Discussion** - Free discussion (~4 min)
4. **Exile** - Vote to suspend one player
5. **Implement** - Give AI instructions
6. **Check** - Verify tower status

---

## Phase Details

### 1. Role Action Phase

Perform role-specific actions (private, no talking).

| Role | Action |
|------|--------|
| **Prophet** | Divine 1 player → Learn if "Apostle" or "Human" |
| **Medium** | View summary of all AI instructions from last round |

### 2. Divine Judgment Phase

God (System) determines 2 interventions:

| Intervention | Effect |
|--------------|--------|
| **Decree of Silence** | Skip Discussion and Exile phases |
| **Word Reversal** | Adjectives mean the opposite (simple → complex) |

⚠️ **You never know when these will trigger!**

### 3. Discussion Phase

~4 minutes of free discussion (skipped if Silence).

- **Deduce**: Who is the Apostle?
- **Share**: Divination/Medium results (lying allowed)
- **Agree**: Who builds what

### 4. Exile Phase

Vote to "suspend" one player (skipped if Silence).

ℹ️ **Note**: Exiled players don't die. They just can't give AI instructions that round.

💡 **Strategy**: If you identify the Apostle, you can neutralize them every round!

### 5. Implement Phase

Each player gives AI instructions (100 chars max, no talking).

| Role | Action |
|------|--------|
| **Human** | Give instructions as agreed |
| **Apostle** | Sneak in sabotage instructions without being caught |

⚠️ If Word Reversal is active, adjectives are flipped!

### 6. Check Phase

After AI execution, verify tower status with the checklist:

- [ ] Screen displays
- [ ] User can interact
- [ ] Responses to interactions exist
- [ ] No obvious breakage
