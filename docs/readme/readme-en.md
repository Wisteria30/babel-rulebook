**BABEL** is a 4-player cooperative board game where you instruct AI to build an app (“the tower”). But hiding among the players is a **“God's Apostle”** secretly trying to destroy it.

Will you complete the tower? Or will betrayal bring it crashing down?

## 🎮 How It Works

1. **Cooperate** — Discuss and agree on what to build each round
2. **Instruct AI** — Each player secretly gives instructions to the AI
3. **Watch Out** — The hidden traitor may sabotage the instructions
4. **Deduce** — Use special roles like Prophet and Medium to find the saboteur
5. **Complete** — After 4 rounds, check if the app works!

## ✨ Features

- 🤖 **Real-time AI integration** — The AI actually builds based on your instructions
- 🔍 **Social deduction** — Find the traitor through discussion and deduction
- ⚡ **God's interference** — Random events like "Silence" and "Word Reversal" shake things up
- 🎭 **4 unique roles** — Prophet, Medium, Citizen, and God's Apostle
